Master-Master arquitecture.
Monitors.
Tests enviroment: Unit and functional testing.

Web Sockets.
Loggers.
Scalability.
Scaling out and up.
Security.

Probably more points are going to be added on the road.

Forums for complaining.

Password Recovery and that things.
Some data apps.

In general, I am going to use javascript. Also this project is going to have code in Python and probably in C# or C.

I am going to write about my experience with that project. I do not expect to teach anybody, with explaining steps I try to explain what I am doing so if I commit a mistake, any programmer will know what I thought in that moment and if I do not do it so bad, people that want to improve their programmatic skills are going to have a friendly documentation.
